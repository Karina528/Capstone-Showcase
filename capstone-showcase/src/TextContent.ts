        Biomedical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
        Computer Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Informatics 
        have been working hard on industry and faculty sponsored projects to 
        solve real-world problems. Teams work collaboratively to carry ideas 
        from initial design through prototype fabrication, testing and evaluation 
        to validate their solutions. As Changemakers, our seniors also consider 
        issues related to ethics, economics, safety and professional practice 
        in their design solutions.`;

export const capstoneDescription: string = `Capstone projects are designed to extend learning beyond the classroom, bridging the gap between education and industry. 
        As the culminating experience of our students' academic journey, 
        these projects integrate knowledge from engineering, science, and the humanities. 
        This event brings together students, faculty, sponsors, alumni, 
        and guests to celebrate the successful completion of these projects. 
        We invite you to connect with our students, explore their work,
