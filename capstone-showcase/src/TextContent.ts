        Biomedical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
        Computer Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Engineering
        Management and Informatics have been working hard on industry and
        faculty sponsored projects to solve real-world problems. Teams work
        collaboratively to carry ideas from initial design through prototype
        fabrication, testing and evaluation to validate their solutions. As
        Changemakers, our seniors also consider issues related to ethics,
        economics, safety and professional practice in their design solutions.`

export const capstoneDescription: string = `The capstone projects are designed to go beyond the classroom to bridge
        the gap between industry and education, and is the final educational
        element that ties to together all the engineering, science, and
        humanities learnings as our students transition to the next phase of
        their lives. This event is an opportunity for our students, faculty,
        sponsors, alumni, and guests to come together to celebrate the
        completion of the projects. We invite you to meet our students and talk
        to them about their projects, their teamwork, and their problem-solving
        strategies.`
